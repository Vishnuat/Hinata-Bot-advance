Method 2: Using the Heroku Dashboard Console
If you prefer not to install the Heroku CLI, you can run the script directly from the Heroku website.

Log in to your Heroku account and go to your dashboard: https://dashboard.heroku.com

Select your bot's application from the list.

In the top-right corner of the page, click on the "More" button.

From the dropdown menu, select "Run console".

A new page will open. In the input field, type the following command:

Bash

'''python3 create_index.py'''
Click the "Run" button next to the input field.

Heroku will then execute the script. You will see the output in the console window below, and it will show a message like "Text index created successfully!" when it is finished.
